Retrospective

1. I continued making commit on Project 2 for 12 days after the due date.
2. I woudln't have completed the project any differently. I think we were given sufficient freedom in our design choices.
3. If I were to extend the project I'd make the job completion percentage updates accessable to the client. Currently they're printed 
to the console of the individual nodes but sending this info to the client would be more useful.
4. I spent about 12 days working on this project, roughly 30 hours. The part that took the most time was figuring out how to run the debug the jobs. 
5. I learned how mapreduce jobs work and that it isn't too difficult to implement a basic distributed system capable of running these types of jobs. I 
wouldn't change anything about this project. 
6. I worked alone on this project.
